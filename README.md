# PyRobots
Robots game built in Python with PyGame

### Coded from memory of old game I used to play (Daleks?)

Uses older version of PyGame but still works.

### Features
- Random enemies spawn in greater numbers as level increases
- Strategic moves, no random deaths
- Move based score

#### Key map
```
q w e \ 
a   d  |=> move one space (in direction from `s` to that key)
z x c /
s = stay in place one turn
t = teleport to safe location
g = toggle map grid
```
